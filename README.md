=================

Hoodie aims to combine the best of the best frameworks into a single package to speed your development.
_It's the zippered hoodie of HTML/CSS frameworks!_

+ Parts of Twitter Bootstrap 1.0 - mostly Alerts, Tabs, Popover and Twipsy
+ Eric Meyer's Reset and Normalize.css combine and de-duplicated
+ Selectivizr
+ Imgsizer
+ HTML5*BOILERPLATE
+ Skeleton Grid Boilerplate.
+ Creamy SASS/SCSS goodness.

Why ANOTHER Framework??
---------------------

Over time we repeatedly reused the same awesome frameworks and libraries, copy/pasting until our little programmer fingers bled… 

…so we took all those pieces and zipped them up into a single package (and bought a box of Band-Aids®).
